## [Unreleased]

## 0.2.1 - 2020-01-18

### Fixed
- Upgrade `syn` and `quote` versions to support newer syntax.

  yet, but they can be supported by crates like
  [`async-trait`](https://crates.io/crates/async-trait)
- [**POTENTIALLY BREAKING**] The `impl Type` block no longer copies the
  attributes of the `impl Trait for Type` block.

## 0.2.0 - 2018-11-01

### Added
- Make generated methods `#[inline(always)]`.

## 0.1.0 - 2018-10-31

### Added
- The `proc_macro` attribute `#[inherent_pub]`.
